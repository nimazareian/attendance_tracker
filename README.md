# Ten Ton Robotics Automated Attendance Tracking System

We are using a Raspberry Pi 4 alongside with a barcode scanner to scan after school students' student card to sign them in and out. This application will track the time spent after school at the Ten Ton Robotics Lab individually and save on Google Sheets for easy access for the class teachers. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to automate the IDS system and calculate if a student has spent the required time to receive credits.

## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB
- Raspberry Pi power supply
- Barcode Scanner
- Mini display for Pi to confirm student signing in/out (optional)
- Micro HDMI to HDMI cable (optional)
