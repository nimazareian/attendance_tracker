# Attendance Tracker
Ten Ton Robotics Automated Attendance Tracking System

We are using a Raspberry Pi 4 alongside with a barcode scanner to scan after school students' student card to sign them in and out. 
Using the gspread library we are able to upload all of the data instantly to a Google Sheet document for teachers to be able to view the students' hours from anywhere.
